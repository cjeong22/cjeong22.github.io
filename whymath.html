            <h1 class = 'header-container'> Why Math? From a CS Concentrator's Perspective</h1>
            <h2 class = 'header-container'> Introduction</h2>
            <div class = 'content-container'> 
                This is going to be a brief discussion as to why I like math. I am not an expert in math by any means. 
                There are many brilliant math concentrators who can give advice as to which courses to take in which order, which 
                professors are best, etc. These are just some thoughts as to why I like math.

            <h2 class = 'header-container'> Problem Solving</h2>
            <div class = 'content-container'> 
                The number one most valuable skill I've gained from my math courses so far is not determining which polynomials 
                have general solutions or why field homomorphisms are injective. It is the intuition behind problem solving that 
                I apply on a day-to-day basis. I know that Representation Theory, Real Analysis, or anything in between is not going to pop up in a 
                technical interview anytime soon. But these topics are so abstract and difficult that many other problems that you see 
                in CS courses will seem less difficult.
            </div>
            <h2 class = 'header-container'> Applications</h2>
            <div class = 'content-container'> 
                A lot of computer science is math. Machine Learning is Statistics + Optimization. Graph Theory is, well, Graph Theory. Cryptography is a combination of Algebra, Number Theory, and Probability. 
                There's active research connecting Type Theory and Algebraic Geometry, Multiprocessor Programming and Algebraic Topology,
                and Functional Programming and Category Theory. One can simply utilize libraries like PyTorch and CryptoPP to train models but 
                understanding the theory behind such mathematics-intensive areas of CS is critical for those who wish to do industry/academic research in the field.
            </div>
            <h2 class = 'header-container'> It's Cool</h2>
            <div class = 'content-container'> 
                Math is really cool. It's all about building facts on top of facts. It's about solving problems for the sake of solving problems. 
                Also, math concentrators and professors tend to be some of the most humble, bright, and friendly people I've ever met.
