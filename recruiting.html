                Recruiting Advice
            </div>
            <div class = 'text-container'>
                I get a couple questions now and then about how to recruit for SWE internships. Here's a quick rundown of how I approached recruiting throughout college.

            <div class = 'text-container'>
                1. Tell an intriguing story
                Ask yourself: What makes me different as a candidate? What's my background? Why am I doing this? Use these questions to guide your responses in interviews.
            </div>
            <div class = 'text-container'>
                2. Specialize
                Finding something you're good at and go all in. Forget everyone who tells you to be a "generalist." No one wants someone who's mediocre across the board. Companies look for depth first, breadth second.

            <div class = 'text-container'>
                3. Don't get nervous
                Recruiting is hard. I've been rejected more times than I can count. I've walked out of interviews feeling great only to get rejected the next week. Just remember you got this :)
