                csci1515 (spring 2024)
                applied cryptography
                
                this is a chill and interesting course.

                it feels a bit hollow in a way. the underlying theory is glossed over, which makes sense given the course name, but it can make some assignments seem too technical for my liking.

                that's just me being picky though, i would highly recommend this course.

                csci2670 (spring 2024)
                graduate operating systems

                csci2670 = csci1670 + csci1690
                
                holy moly man this course is a lot.

                not too conceptually difficult on the surface, but there are so many moving parts that need to come together precisely, which is where the difficulty of this course lies.
                
                i speedran the course until the last project, touched some grass, then slowly worked on the last project. i highly recommend this strategy.

                math1540 (spring 2024)
                topics in abstract algebra
                
                a perfect sequel to math1530.

                i think i spent more time on this course than i did on csci2670, which is saying a lot.
                
                when i took it, the course covered galois theory and representation theory. rather than build upon simple structures math1530, math1540 builds upon more complicated structures and complicates them even more LMAO.

                i highly recomend this course to my fellow math1530 lovers.

                math1580 (spring 2024) 
                cryptography
                
                super fun course that's not too conceptually difficult 

                this is one of two undergraduate theoretical cryptography courses here at brown. math1580 covers the mathematics behind cryptography, such as modular groups, finite fields, factoring, and prime numbers. complexity theory is covered lightly but csci1510 (introduction to cryptography and computer security) dives a lot deeper into it.

                math1530 (fall 2023)
                abstract algebra
                
                the best course i've taken at brown so far.

                it's so beautiful, simple, and rich. who knew that numbers could have some properties?

                my first tat is gonna be the first isomorphism theorem.

                i recommend taking math1530 instead of csci0220 (discrete structures and probability); the material is similar but math1530 is just... wow

                biol1455 (summer 2023)
                planetary health
                
                i took this course to fulfill some requirements for brown's concurrent master's program.

                overall it was really chill. it's asynchronous so i completed assignments at my own pace. i'm not too interested in the material nor am i too good at biology in general, so i'm not too sure about how it lines up with other biology courses here.

                apma1650 (spring 2023)
                statistical inference i
                
                yet another questionable non-honors course.

                like math0520, i highly recommend taking apma1655 (honors statistical inference i), because man this course is not rigorous enough.

                unlike math0520, i recommend that everyone take apma1655, not just math/applied math concentrators.

                csci0200 (spring 2023)
                data structures and algorithms
                
                a questionable course to say the least.

                definitely a step up conceptually from csci0150. overall the assignments and exams felt fine; my main gripe is with the course staff and materials. the materials were unreadable at times and when i brought up my concerns to the staff i was martryed (and they didn't fix the materials).

                i hesitantly recommend this course and would recommend some leetcode prep beforehand.

                csci0150 (fall 2022)
                introduction to object-oriented programming
                
                this is the best cs intro course imo.
                
                i claim the above not because it's exceptionally taught or anything but because every course from here on out kinda runs under the assumption that you took csci0150. 

                it's a pretty average time commitment and fun! i highly recommend it.

                principles of economics
                
                this course is hard.

                there's a reason why other schools of principles of macroeconomics and principles of microeconomics. for some reason, brown just mashes these two into one course, but somehow, they make it work.

                linear algebra
                
                if you have any desire to go into math/applied math, take math0540 (honors linear algebra) instead.

                this is a pretty mind-numbing course; i don't think i learned anything particularly notable, and if i did, i promptly forgot it LOL.

                i would say if you aren't a math/applied math concentrator then this course is really easy and looks good on a resume
