                Kind of an anomaly of a course, which makes me enjoy it so much more. <br>
                CSCI 1260 dives into the intersection of formal methods, assembly/systems <br>
                programming, software development, and type theory. The professor is <br>
                brilliant, a very effective lecturer, and a kind person.

                So far (Fall 2023) my favorite class in the CS department. The <br>
                professor is a true pioneer of his field and extremely knowledgeable, <br>
                yet he is humble and cares deeply about his students. The course is <br>
                somewhat difficult; I would say the time commitment is similar to <br>
                that of CSCI 0150 but the work is much more intellectually <br>
                stimulating. Programming assignments are difficult and require <br>
                close attention to detail.

                Everyone considering CS should take this class. Extremely applicable <br>
                content. I don't want to jump the gun here but I feel like this is <br>
                the most important class offered by the CS department here. Of <br>
                course, it is a bit of a logistical and organizational nightmare <br>
                due to the sheer size of the course, but that does not stop this <br>
                course from getting my highest recommendation. Programming assignments <br>
                are difficult at first but quickly become trivial. Midterm and Final <br>
                are very manageable.

                I found this to be a pretty fun introduction to CS. Covering Java and <br>
                Object-Oriented programming practices, CSCI 0150 is a slow-paced yet <br>
                informative course on how to program. The work is not intellectually <br>
                stimulating but is vast in quantity.
