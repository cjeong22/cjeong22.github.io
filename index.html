    there is no one in this room who can stand against me
    <br>
    your mothers warned you about my coming
    <br>
    fear the moment
    <br>
    but you think you could have a chance 
    <br>
    but you're afraid 
    <br>
    what if i could be the One 
    <br>
    this could be the moment you've been praying for, all your life 
    <br>
    you're praying now
    <br>
    to your grandmother
    <br>
    she died nine moons ago
    <br>
    she lost an eye
    <br>
    a rock smashed her face as she was crossing the belt
    <br>
    she was twelve when it happened
    <br>
    at that time, this world had a fremen name
    <br>
    Dune.
    <br>
    in your nightmares
    <br>
    you give water to the dead
    <br>
    and it brings joy to your heart
    <br>
    mahdi, what do you forsee for us?
    <br>
    green paradise
    <br>
    lisan al-gaib 
    <br>
    show us the way
    <br>
    this is my father's ducal signet 
    <br>
    i am paul muad-dib atreides, duke of arrakis
    <br>
    the hand of god be my witness
    <br>
    i am the Voice from the outer world
    <br>
    i will lead you
    <br>
    to PARADISE
</body>
