                So Brown has this cool program called the concurrent master's program where undergraduates can obtain both master's and bachelor's
                degrees in their four years at Brown. The details of this program are pretty obfuscated so I'm writing this to help clear
                up the process for any interested undergraduates.

            <h2 class = 'header-container'> Motivations</h2>
            <div class = 'content-container'>
                Many of my peers choose to pursue this degree option as a means to boost their chances in the H1B lottery. Many more
                hope to qualify themselves for ML Engineer and Data Scientist roles. I personally decided to pursue a concurrent master's 
                degree because it's financially smart and I wanted to preemptively check the box for more senior roles that may require an advanced degree.

            <h2 class = 'header-container'> Details</h2>
            <div class = 'content-container'>
                Obviously in order to obtain both a bachelor's and master's degree, one must complete the course requirements for both a bachelor's
                and a master's degree. For computer science, this entails completing a bachelor of science in cs or one of the joint concentrations 
                (math-cs, apma-cs, cs-econ) and completing a master of science in cs. Where the requirements get confusing is in the breadth and depth
                requirements Brown imposes: those pursuing a concurrent degree must complete a total of ten courses in the physical sciences, social sciences,
                life sciences, and humanities, with a minimum of two courses in each section. Within the area of study that one wants to obtain their
                master's degree in, the breadth requirements used must not count for concentration credit. For example, I'm pursuing a bachelor's degree
                in cs, which falls under physical sciences; therefore, my breadth requirements that I use for physical sciences cannot also be used
                to complete my cs degree.
