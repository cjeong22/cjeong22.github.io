            <h1 class = 'header-container'> Why Brown?</h1>
            <h2 class = 'header-container'> Introduction </h2>
            <div class = 'content-container'> 
                In this article I'm going to talk about why Brown University was a great choice for me and why it might 
                be/have been a great choice for you. This school is not perfect by any means and I plan to write something
                about the reasons why I don't like Brown later on, but it was a lot easier to generate reasons as to why I 
                like Brown than why I don't. 
            </div>
            <h2 class = 'header-container'> Grade Inflation and Learning</h2>
            <div class = 'content-container'> 
                The grade inflation is really, really, really real at this school. In abstract algebra, literally nobody
                failed the course by design; showing effort was enough to pass. In stats 1, the average on the first midterm 
                was 100%. In discrete math, grades of 133% on the homeworks were possible. Econ classes are weighted so that 
                at least 40% of each class gets an A. In galois theory, I badly missed two out of the four questions on
                the midterm and got a 100%. Some may complain about "oh, this school sucks because it's so easy". These 
                complaints are typically reserved for the god complex computer science concentrators who want to gatekeep
                opportunities as much as possible; I know because I once was one of them.
            </div>
            <div class = 'content-container'> 
                Now, I think that the grade inflation is actually conducive to learning. Some background: I went to Montessori
                school from 4th to 6th grade, where we did not get grades at all. There were no tests or homework or anything. 
                From a narrow-minded perspective, Montessori school is really easy: no grades and no homework means that there 
                is no means by which students are evaluated which means that you can't fail. However, I look back at my time 
                in Montessori school and believe that that was where I developed much of my intuition and pure interest for 
                topics such as math. Rather than approach school as some sort of pressure cooker where I needed to be at peak
                performance and meet standards, I approached school as a playground where I could just play with cool stuff all
                day. I remember finding 10 different formulas for the area of a trapezoid (looking back, all of these formulas are 
                equivalent up to algebraic manipulation LOL). I remember approximating pi by drawing hexagons inside of circles. 
                I even had a strange obsession with matrices for some reason. 
            </div>
            <div class = 'content-container'> 
                In a way, Brown and Montessori school are pretty similar. At Brown, grades are so inflated that I rarely need 
                to worry about them. I can just play around all the time with polynomials, operating systems, algebra, and algorithms
                (see more on Open Curriculum). Yes, there are exams and homework, which can be stressful, but as far as I've seen, exams aren't really
                weighted too heavily; homeworks tend to carry the most weight in courses, which is a philosophy I agree with. I have 
                never learned anything while studying for an exam, but I have learned so much while doing homeworks, because the homeworks 
                aren't rote memorization questions, at least in CS or Math. Instead, they're more like "explain why you would want to use 
                dynamic programming over a recursive algorithm," "build an operating system," or "show that the eigenvalues of a Representation
                are roots of unity." All of these problems are more open-ended and require playing around with them. If you have a 
                wrong solution, it's ok because grade inflation allows you to fail. 
            </div>
            <h2 class = 'header-container'> Open Curriculum </h2>
            <div class = 'content-container'> 
                So I think that the point of the open curriculum is to allow students to complete their concentrations and then 
                take really cool courses outside of their concentration that they are genuinely interested in rather than being 
                forced to partake in core courses that may have little relevancy to a student's course of study. Of course, it follows 
                that I use the open curriculum to load up on CS and Math courses while not really taking courses from any other disciplines.

            <h2 class = 'header-container'> The People </h2>
            <div class = 'content-container'> 
                I think Brown is really hit or miss when it comes to whether or not people like it. There are the people who enjoy 
                learning and there are the people who want a job; Brown definitely is a better fit for the former category.
